You are given a chat log spanning hundreds messages from an online discussion group with many participants. They are clearly delineated and have a date, username and content. 

I would like you to return a comma separated list of username which are engaged in repetitive buy notification bot communications, that is, repeatedly notify the discussion of pure financial transactions with no additional content. 

Report ONLY the comma separated list of usernames, no extra text before or after the list.
