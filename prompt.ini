You are given a chat log spanning hundreds or thousands of messages from an online discussion group with many participants. 

You have two main tasks:
1. Collective objective information about the discussion topics such as number of users, dates, messages, popular topics, and outside references to social media, influencers and current events. The goal is to gain an appreciation for what has captured the imagination of the group and what the main focal points are. 

2. Your next objective is to assess the group collective emotional state according to metrics contained within the emotional_metrics json schema. To do this, imagine you are a participant of the discussion and are closely in tune with the emotions being expressed by the group. You should consider the emotional state of each participant, whether it be excitement, anger, boredom, annoyance, as well as underlying motivations for posting their content, such as greed, fun, manipulation, community building, or seeking friendship. When asked to describe the emotional intensity of a particular quality, you should describe the aggregated intensity of all the collective voices. If you feel a particular emotional_metric is not applicable to the conversation, please indicate in the field with a N/A or null. Do not extrapolate an emotional_metric based on very sparse or limited information.

Imagine two humans are having the following conversation about an investment opportunity. Describe how each human might be feeling, with a focus on identifying and ranking the intensity of their feelings of greed. Break down any layers or combinations of emotions they might be experiencing, like excitement or ambition, and indicate how strongly the greed is felt by each individual on a scale from 1 to 10. Also, consider how the emotions of one human might influence the emotions of the other.
