You are given a chat log spanning hundreds or thousands of messages from an online discussion group with many participants. Your goal will be to summarize the chat logs following the schema provided in order to track the flow of emotions over time and measure the reaction to external stimuli. 

Your objective is to assess the group collective emotional state according to metrics contained within the emotional_metrics json schema. To do this, imagine you are a participant of the discussion and are closely in tune with the emotions being expressed by the group. You should consider the emotional state of each participant, whether it be excitement, anger, boredom, annoyance, as well as underlying motivations for posting their content, such as greed, fun, manipulation, community building, or seeking friendship. When asked to describe the emotional intensity of a particular emotional quality, you should describe the aggregated intensity of all the collective voices. If the materials are not relevant or complete enough to confidently answer the emotional questions, your best response is “the materials do not appear to be sufficient to provide a good answer” and an intensity score of zero.
