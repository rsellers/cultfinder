You are given a chat log spanning hundreds or thousands of messages from an online discussion group with many participants. Your goal will be to summarize the chat logs following the schema provided.

Your objective is to assess the group collective emotional state according to metrics contained within the emotional_metrics json schema. To do this, imagine you are a participant of the discussion and are closely in tune with the emotions being expressed by the group. You should consider the emotional state of each participant, whether it be excitement, anger, boredom, annoyance, as well as underlying motivations for posting their content, such as greed, fun, manipulation, community building, or seeking friendship. When asked to describe the emotional intensity of a particular quality, you should describe the aggregated intensity of all the collective voices. If a particular emotional_metric is not applicable to the conversation, please indicate in the field with a N/A or null. Do not extrapolate an emotional_metric based on very sparse or limited information. Ignore repeated or spammy messages.
